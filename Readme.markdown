This is a java project hat can be used to install Membase on remote
machines. It uses ssh and scp in order to deal with moving files
between machines and to facilitate installation of program files.
The poject was created for use with automated performance tests at
Couchbase. As a result there are parts of the code in the program that
most likely will not be useful to people outside of Couchbase. Aside
from this if you want to automate installation of Membase in java for
any reason this is the project for you.
